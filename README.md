## Installation

### Step 1: Check .NET Runtime
Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:
```
dotnet --list-runtimes
```

✅ **If you see** `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.x.x` or higher → Skip to Step 3

❌ **If you get an error** or don't see version 8.x or higher → Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Install .NET Runtime
Download and install **.NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime** (or newer):

👉 [Download .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime (x64)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.11-windows-x64-installer)

> **Note:** .NET 9.x or higher will also work.

### Step 3: Download & Run
1. Download `AutoDeleteScreenshot.exe` from [Latest Release](https://github.com/TungCorn/auto-delete-screenshot/releases/latest)
2. Double-click to run
3. **Important:** On first launch, right-click the tray icon and choose **"📂 Select Screenshots folder..."** to tell the app where your screenshots are saved.
4. The app will appear in your system tray (bottom-right corner)

### Step 4: Configure (Optional)
Right-click the tray icon to:
- Set deletion time (15 min / 30 min / 1 hour / 24 hours)
- Enable notifications
- Enable "Run at Windows startup"

## How It Works

```
📸 You take a screenshot
        ↓
🏷️ App renames it: Screenshot_AUTODEL_1234567890.png
        ↓
⏰ Timer runs every 60 seconds
        ↓
🗑️ Expired files get deleted automatically
```

Only files with `_AUTODEL_` tag are deleted. Your other files are **100% safe**.
